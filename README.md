## Assignment: CSS Day 4 - Enhancing Dashboard

### Objective

Enhance the dashboard of your Pet Adoption website by adding responsive design features using media queries and incorporating basic CSS animations. This assignment aims to solidify your understanding of responsive web design and CSS animations.

### Instructions

#### Part 1: Implementing Media Queries

- **Modify the Dashboard**:

  - Continue working in your `CSS-Pet-Adoption` repository and focus on the `dashboard.html` file.

- **Responsive Sidebar**:

  - Use a media query to adjust the layout for smaller screens.
  - On smaller screens, the sidebar should be positioned above the main content.

- **Image and Text Layout**:
  - Modify the layout of the new arrivals section so that the text is under the images on small screens.

#### Part 2: Adding Basic Animations

- **Incorporate CSS Animations**:

  - Add at least one CSS animation to your dashboard.
  - Examples include growing an image on hover, animating links on hover, or other creative uses of animation.

- **Ensure Subtlety and Functionality**:
  - Ensure that the animations enhance the user experience and are not overly distracting.
  - Test the animations to make sure they function correctly across different browsers.

#### Part 3: Test, Validate, and Deploy

- **Responsiveness Testing**:

  - Test your dashboard on various devices and screen sizes to ensure the layout adjusts correctly.
  - Verify that the media query effectively changes the layout on smaller screens.

- **Animation and Interaction**:

  - Ensure that animations are smooth and enhance the overall interaction on the page.

- **Deploy and Submit**:
  - Deploy the updated website with the responsive dashboard and animations.
  - Submit links to your GitHub repository and the live site.
